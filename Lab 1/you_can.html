    <h1>You Can</h1> 
    <h4>By George Matthew Adams</h4>
    <p>From the introductory: "The Welcome Man" "There's a man in the world who is never turned down, wherever he chances to stray; he gets the glad hand in the populous town, or out where the farmers make hay; he's greeted with pleasure on deserts of sand, and deep in the aisles of the woods; wherever he goes there's the welcoming hand-he's The Man Who Delivers The Goods. The failures of life sit around and complain; the gods haven't treated them white; they've lost their umbrellas whenever there's rain, and they haven't their lanterns at night; men tire of the failures who fill with their sighs the air of their own neighborhoods; there's one who is greeted with love-lighted eyes-he's The Man Who Delivers The Goods. One fellow is lazy, and watches the clock, and waits for the whistle to blow; and one has a hammer, with which he will knock, and one tells a story of woe; and one, if requested to travel a mile, will measure the perches and roods; but one does his stunt with a whistle or smile-he's The Man Who Delivers The Goods. One man is afraid that he'll labor too hard-the world isn't yearning for such; and one man is always alert, on his guard, lest he put in a minute too much; and one has a grouch or a temper that's bad, and one is a creature of moods; so it's hey for the joyous and rollicking lad-for the One Who Delivers The Goods. * * * * "For though gamesters say that the cards beat all the players, though they were never so skilful, yet in the contest we are now considering the players are also the game and share the power of the cards."</p>
